  <h2 class="fixed-width">Abstract</h2>
  <p class="center-align fixed-width text-justify">
    Daily life support robots in the home environment interpret the user’s pointing and understand the instructions, thereby increasing the number of instructions accomplished.
    This study aims to improve the estimation performance of pointing frames by using speech information when a person gives pointing or verbal instructions to the robot.
    The estimation of the pointing frame, which represents the moment when the user points, can help the user understand the instructions. 
    Therefore, we perform pointing frame estimation using a time-series model, utilizing the user’s speech, images, and speech-recognized text observed by the robot. 
    In our experiments, we set up realistic communication conditions, such as speech containing everyday conversation, non-upright posture, actions other than pointing, and reference objects outside the robot’s field of view. 
    The results showed that adding speech information improved the estimation performance, especially the Transformer model with Mel-Spectrogram as a feature. 
    This study will lead to be applied to object localization and action planning in 3D environments by robots in the future. The

  <h2 class="fixed-width">Approach</h2>
  <p class="center-align fixed-width text-justify">
    The purpose of our study is to verify the extent to which the performance of pointing frame estimations can be enhanced through the integration of human speech data during human-robot interactions involving gestures and language. 
    We introduce a pointing frame estimator that leverages human speech information across various scenarios where individuals provide instructions to a robot using gestures and language.
  </p>
  <ul class="fixed-width list-centered">
    <li>A scenario involving verbal utterances including daily conversations</li>
    <li>A scenario in which a user's posture is not consistently upright</li>
    <li>A scenario in which a user's movements include actions beyond pointing</li>
    <li>A scenario in which the referenced object is outside the visual scope of the robot</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="center-align fixed-width text-justify">
    We gather audio-visual time series data from the robot under these specified conditions and train our pointing frame estimator, allowing us to accurately estimate pointing frames in real-world scenarios.
    We also investigate which audio features are better at estimating pointing frames.
    We incorporate speech data into the pointing frame estimation framework proposed by Chen et al. to estimate the pointing frame under conditions of natural communication between a human and a daily life service robot. 
    An overview of the proposed model is depicted in Figure 2.

<!--   <h2 class="fixed-width">Speech and Video Prosessing</h2>
  <p class="center-align fixed-width text-justify">
  Chen et al.'s framework for pointing frame estimation incorporates a textual object reference expression as an input. 
  However, in actual environments, it is probable that language and gestures beyond reference expressions and pointing are also frequently utilized. 
  In such scenarios, human speech data could be a pivotal factor in the estimation of pointing frames. 
  Consequently, this approach leverages the speech uttered by the speaker during pointing to estimate the pointing frame.
  Initially, speech recognition is executed on the speaker's voice employing the Whisper model as a speech recognition tool. 
  The framework is expanded by integrating the textual data derived from the recognition outcomes into Chen et al.'s framework.
  
  Subsequently, the user's speech is segmented at regular intervals. 
  The segmented speech is then isolated using an acoustic feature extraction mechanism. 
  The specifics of this extractor are explained in the experimental section. 
  These acoustic features serve as input for the pointing frame estimator outlined below. 
  Simultaneously, the video depicting the act of pointing towards an object is partitioned into frames at consistent intervals corresponding to the audio segmentation.
  </p>

  <h2 class="fixed-width">Features Fusion Module</h2>
  <p class="center-align fixed-width text-justify">
  This module converts and fuses image and text data processed by audio and video processing into various features.
  Initially, we explain the processing of segmented images in both audio and video. 
  Two distinct types of processing are conducted on these segmented images. 
  The first involves the extraction of the user's gesture features. 
  To accomplish this, we employ the same extraction method as utilized by Chen et al. 
  Specifically, we utilize Openpose for skeletal detection and MSI-Net for generating a saliency map that represents the region indicated by the speaker. 
  The features acquired from MSI-Net are then fed into the convolutional layer. 
    
  Secondly, we conduct in the process of extracting image features.
  Subsequently, the textual data derived from the speech recognition underwent processing via BERT, followed by additional processing through two fully concatenated layers. 
  In this study, we employed the Japanese pre-trained BERT model. 
  The textual features are derived from the technique of this reference and are integrated with the image features using a technique that accentuates specific regions of the image.
  
  Finally, all features are concatenated and input to the object rectangle estimator.
  </p>

  <h2 class="fixed-width">Object Rectangle Estimator</h2>
  <p class="center-align fixed-width text-justify">
  An anchor-based predictor is employed to predict the rectangular region including the object. 
  The loss of the predictor is the loss related to the difference in rectangular regions (\( L_{bb} \)) and the loss to increase the diversity of the model's attention span (\( L_{atten} \)).
    The output generated by the predictor includes the XY coordinates of the central point of the rectangular region, as well as the width, height, and confidence score of the region.
  </p>

  <h2 class="fixed-width">Pointing Frame Estimator</h2>
  <p class="center-align fixed-width text-justify">
  As the pointing frame estimator deals with time series data, it is important for the model to incorporate both preceding and subsequent time-series information surrounding the pointing frame. 
  In this study, we contrast two methods capable of integrating time-series data within the pointing frame estimator.

  Initially, we employ a Transformer based on an Encoder-Decoder model that incorporates the Attention mechanism. 
  In this study, the Transformer is pre-trained on the YouRefIt dataset by Chen et al. and then fine-tuned using the newly collected dataset in this study. 
  We construct a three-layer Transformer encoder with four attention heads in both directions. 
  The input to the Transformer is acoustic features and features derived from an estimator for the rectangular region of the object. 
  To utilize these features effectively, we have to reduce the dimensionality of the data before inputting it into the Transformer during the fine-tuning phase. 
  There are two tools utilized for dimensionality reduction. 
  Initially, we employ a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to reduce the dimensionality of the features obtained from the rectangular region estimator. 
  Following dimensionality reduction via CNN, a weight matrix \( W \) is applied to the acoustic and compressed features, where the diagonal component is set to 1, and Gaussian noise is introduced to the remaining components. 
  The purpose of \( W \) is to extract the features obtained from the estimator in the rectangular region of the object by setting the diagonal component to 1 while introducing Gaussian noise to the features derived from the voice. 
  This adjustment aligns the dimensionality of the input data during the fine-tuning process of the Transformer.

  Next, we employ Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM). 
  Bi-LSTM is a model that integrates forward and backward LSTMs. 
  In contrast to the Transformer, Bi-LSTM does not necessitate a large dataset and can be trained from scratch. 
  Given its training from scratch, Bi-LSTM does not utilize a weight matrix but instead relies on a concatenation of features derived from the rectangular estimator and acoustic features.
  The output of the pointing frame estimator is a scalar ranging from 0 to 1, meaning the likelihood that the input image corresponds to a pointing frame. 
  When the output is 1, it means that the image is predicted to be a pointing frame.
